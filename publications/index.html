      <p>Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key. To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time. To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS’20). We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way. Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.</p>

      <p>Advancements in quantum computing pose a significant threat to most of the cryptography currently deployed. Fortunately, cryptographic building blocks to mitigate the threat are already available; mostly based on post-quantum and quantum cryptography, but also on symmetric cryptography techniques. Notably, quantum-safe building blocks must be deployed as soon as possible due to the “harvest-now decrypt-later” attack scenario, which is already challenging our sensitive and encrypted data today. Following an agile defense-in-depth approach, Hybrid Authenticated Key Exchange (HAKE) protocols have recently been gaining significant attention. Such protocols modularly combine conventional, post-quantum, and quantum cryptography to achieve confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees for network channels. Unfortunately, only a few protocols have yet been proposed (mainly Muckle and Muckle+) with different flexibility guarantees. Looking at available standards in the network domain (especially at the Media Access Control Security (MACsec) standard), we believe that HAKE protocols could already bring strong security benefits to MACsec today. MACsec is a standard designed to secure communication at the data link layer in Ethernet networks by providing security for all traffic between adjacent entities. In addition, MACsec establishes secure channels within a Local Area Network (LAN), ensuring that data remain protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, while operating transparently to higher layer protocols. Currently, MACsec does not offer enough protection in the event of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. In this work, we tackle the challenge and propose a new versatile HAKE protocol, dubbed VMuckle, which is sufficiently flexible for the use in MACsec to provide LAN participants with hybrid key material ensuring secure communication.</p>

      <p>Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) are variants of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) in which complex statements can be proven in a compact way. SNARKs have had tremendous impact in several areas of cryptography, including verifiable computing, blockchains, and anonymous communication. A recurring concept in many applications is the concept of recursive SNARKs, in which a proof references a previous proof to show an evolved statement. In this work, we investigate malleable SNARKs, a generalization of this concept of recursion. An adaptation of the existing concept of malleable NIZKs, malleable SNARKs allow to modify SNARK proofs to show related statements, but such that such mauled proofs are indistinguishable from “properly generated” fresh proofs of the related statement. We show how to instantiate malleable SNARKs for universal languages and relations, and give a number of applications: the first post-quantum RCCA-secure rerandomizable and updatable encryption schemes, a generic construction of reverse firewalls, and an unlinkable (i.e., computation-hiding) targeted malleable homomorphic encryption scheme. Technically, our malleable SNARK construction relies on recursive proofs, but with a twist: in order to support the strong indistinguishability properties of mauled and fresh SNARK proofs, we need to allow an unbounded recursion depth. To still allow for a reasonable notion of extractability in this setting (and in particular to guarantee that extraction eventually finishes with a “proper” witness that does not refer to a previous SNARK proof), we rely on a new and generic computational primitive called adversarial one-way function (AOWF) that may be of independent interest. We give an AOWF candidate and prove it secure in the random oracle model.</p>

      <p>We construct an identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme that is tightly secure in a very strong sense. Specifically, we consider a setting with many instances of the scheme and many encryptions per instance. In this setting, we reduce the security of our scheme to a variant of a simple assumption used for a similar purpose by Chen and Wee (Crypto 2013). The security loss of our reduction is O(k)(where k is the security parameter). Our scheme is the first IBE scheme to achieve this strong flavor of tightness under a simple assumption. Technically, our scheme is a variation of the IBE scheme by Chen and Wee. However, in order to "lift" their results to the multi-instance, multi-ciphertext case, we need to develop new ideas. In particular, while we build on (and extend) their high-level proof strategy, we deviate significantly in the low-level proof steps.</p>

      <p>We propose a novel variant of functional encryption which supports ciphertext updates, dubbed ciphertext updatable functional encryption (CUFE). Such a feature further broadens the practical applicability of the functional encryption paradigm and is carried out via so-called update tokens. However, allowing update tokens requires some care for the security definition as we want that updates can be done by any semi-trusted third party and only on ciphertexts. Our contribution is three-fold: a) We define our new primitive with a security notion in the indistinguishability setting. Within CUFE, functional decryption keys and ciphertexts are labeled with tags such that only if the tag of the decryption key and the ciphertext match, then decryption succeeds. Furthermore, we allow ciphertexts to switch their tags to any other tag via update tokens. Such tokens are generated by the holder of the main secret key and can only be used in the desired direction. b) We present a generic construction of CUFE for any functionality as well as predicates different from equality testing on tags, which relies on the existence of (probabilistic) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). c) We present a practical construction of CUFE for the inner-product functionality from standard assumptions (i.e., LWE) in the random-oracle model. On the technical level, we build on the recent functional encryption schemes with fine-grained access control and linear operations on encrypted data (Abdalla et al., AC’20) and introduce an additional ciphertext updatability feature. Proving security for such a construction turned out to be non-trivial, particularly when revealing keys for the updated challenge ciphertext is allowed. Overall, such construction enriches the set of known inner-product functional-encryption schemes with the additional updatability feature of ciphertexts.</p>

      <p>Updatable encryption (UE) allows a third party to periodically rotate encryption keys from one epoch to another without the need to download, decrypt, re-encrypt, and upload already encrypted data by a client. Updating those outsourced ciphertexts is carried out via the use of so-called update tokens which in turn are generated during key rotation and can be sent (publicly) to the third party. The arguably most efficient variant of UE is ciphertext-independent UE as the key rotation does not depend on the outsourced ciphertexts which makes it particularly interesting in scenarios where access to (information of the) ciphertexts is not possible during key rotation. Available security notions cannot guarantee any form of _forward security_ (i.e., old ciphertexts are in danger after key leakage). Counter-intuitively, forward security would violate correctness, as ciphertexts should be updatable ad-infinitum given the update token. In this work, we investigate if we can have at least some form of "controlled" forward security to mitigate the following shortcoming: an adversary would record available information (i.e., some ciphertexts, all update tokens) and simply would wait for a single key leakage to decrypt all data ever encrypted. Our threefold contribution is as follows: a) First, we introduce an epoch-based UE CPA security notion to allow fine-grained updatability. It covers the concept of expiry epochs, i.e., ciphertexts can lose the ability of being updatable via a token after a certain epoch has passed. This captures the above mentioned shortcoming as the encrypting party can decide how long a ciphertext can be updatable (and, hence, decryptable). b) Second, we introduce a novel approach of constructing UE which significantly departs from previous ones and in particular views UE from the perspective of puncturable encryption (Green and Miers, S&amp;P’15). We define tag-inverse puncturable encryption as a new variant that generalizes UE and may be of independent interest. c) Lastly, we present and prove secure the first UE scheme with the aforementioned properties. It is constructed via tag-inverse puncturable encryption and instantiated from standard assumptions. As it turned out, constructing such puncturing schemes is not straightforward and we require adapted proof techniques. Surprisingly, as a special case, this yields the first backwards-leak UE scheme with sub-linear ciphertexts from standard assumptions (an open problem posted in two recent works by Jiang Galteland and Pan &amp; Miao et al., PKC’23).</p>

      <p>Secure communication protocols such as TLS 1.3 or QUIC are doing the heavy lifting in terms of security of today’s Internet. These modern protocols provide modes that do not need an interactive handshake, but allow to send cryptographically protected data with the first client message in zero round-trip time (0-RTT). While this helps to reduce communication latency, the security of such protocols in terms of forward security is rather weak. In recent years, the academic community investigated ways of mitigating this problem and achieving full forward security and replay resilience for such 0-RTT protocols. In particular, this can be achieved via a so-called Puncturable Key Encapsulation Mechanism (PKEM). While the first such schemes were too expensive to be used in practice, Derler et al. (EUROCRYPT 2018) proposed a variant of PKEMs called Bloom Filter Key Encapsulation Mechanism (BFKEM). Unfortunately, these primitives have only be investigated asymptotically and no real benchmarks were conducted. Dallmeier et al. (CANS 2020) were the first to study their practical application within the QUIC protocol. They build upon a specific BFKEM instantiation and conclude that while it comes with significant computational overhead, its practical use is feasible, especially in applications where the increased CPU and memory load can be tolerated. In this paper, we revisit their choice of the concrete BFKEM instantiation and show that by relying on the concept of Time-based BFKEMs (TB-BFKEMs), also introduced by Derler et al. (EUROCRYPT 2018), one can combine the advantages of having computational efficiency and smaller key sizes. We thereby investigate algorithmic as well as conceptual optimizations with various trade-offs and conclude that our approach seems favorable for many practical settings. Overall, this extends the applicability of 0-RTT protocols with strong security in practice.</p>

      <p>End-to-end authenticity in public networks plays a significant role. Namely, without authenticity, the adversary might be able to retrieve even confidential information straight away by impersonating others. Proposed solutions to establish an authenticated channel cover pre-shared key-based, password-based, and certificate-based techniques. To add confidentiality to an authenticated channel, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols usually have one of the three solutions built in. As an amplification, hybrid AKE (HAKE) approaches are getting more popular nowadays and were presented in several flavors to incorporate classical, post-quantum, or quantum-key-distribution components. The main benefit is redundancy, i.e., if some of the components fail, the primitive still yields a confidential and authenticated channel. However, current HAKE instantiations either rely on pre-shared keys (which yields inefficient end-to-end authenticity) or only support one or two of the three above components (resulting in reduced redundancy and flexibility). In this work, we present an extension of a modular HAKE framework due to Dowling, Brandt Hansen, and Paterson (PQCrypto’20) that does not suffer from the above constraints. While their instantiation, dubbed Muckle, requires pre-shared keys (and hence yields inefficient end-to-end authenticity), our extended instantiation called Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. While replacing pre-shared keys with digital signatures is rather straightforward in general, this turned out to be surprisingly non-trivial when applied to HAKE frameworks (resulting in a significant model change with adapted proof techniques).</p>

      <p>Hierarchical Identity Based Encryption (HIBE) is a well studied, versatile tool used in many cryptographic protocols. Yet, since the performance of all known HIBE constructions is broadly considered prohibitive, some real-world applications avoid relying on HIBE at the expense of security. A prominent example for this is secure messaging: Strongly secure messaging protocols are provably equivalent to Key-Updatable Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KU-KEMs; Balli et al., Asiacrypt 2020); so far, all KU-KEM constructions rely on adaptive unbounded-depth HIBE (Poettering and Rösler, Jaeger and Stepanovs, both CRYPTO 2018). By weakening security requirements for better efficiency, many messaging protocols dispense with using HIBE. In this work, we aim to gain better efficiency without sacrificing security. For this, we observe that applications like messaging only need a restricted variant of HIBE for strong security. This variant, that we call Unique-Path Identity Based Encryption (UPIBE), restricts HIBE by requiring that each secret key can delegate at most one subordinate secret key. However, in contrast to fixed secret key delegation in Forward-Secure Public Key Encryption, the delegation in UPIBE, as in HIBE, is uniquely determined by variable identity strings from an exponentially large space. We investigate this mild but surprisingly effective restriction and show that it offers substantial complexity and performance advantages. More concretely, we generically build bounded-depth UPIBE from only bounded-collusion IBE in the standard model; and we generically build adaptive unbounded-depth UPIBE from only selective bounded-depth HIBE in the random oracle model. These results significantly extend the range of underlying assumptions and efficient instantiations. We conclude with a rigorous performance evaluation of our UPIBE design. Beyond solving challenging open problems by reducing complexity and improving efficiency of KU-KEM and strongly secure messaging protocols, we offer a new definitional perspective on the bounded-collusion setting.</p>

    <div class="abstract hidden">
      <p>Forward secrecy is considered an essential design goal of modern key establishment (KE) protocols, such as TLS 1.3, for example. Furthermore, efficiency considerations such as zero round-trip time (0-RTT), where a client is able to send cryptographically protected pay- load data along with the very first KE message, are motivated by the practical demand for secure low-latency communication. For a long time, it was unclear whether protocols that simultaneously achieve 0-RTT and full forward secrecy exist. Only recently, the first forward-secret 0-RTT protocol was described by Günther et al. (Euro- crypt 2017). It is based on Puncturable Encryption. Forward secrecy is achieved by “puncturing” the secret key after each decryption operation, such that a given ciphertext can only be decrypted once (cf. also Green and Miers, S&amp;P 2015). Unfortunately, their scheme is completely impractical, since one puncturing operation takes between 30 seconds and several minutes for reasonable security and deployment parameters, such that this solution is only a first feasibility result, but not efficient enough to be deployed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new primitive that we term Bloom Filter Encryption (BFE), which is derived from the probabilistic Bloom filter data structure. We describe different constructions of BFE schemes, and show how these yield new puncturable encryption mechanisms with extremely efficient puncturing. Most importantly, a puncturing operation only involves a small number of very efficient computations, plus the deletion of certain parts of the secret key, which outperforms previous constructions by orders of magnitude. This gives rise to the first forward-secret 0-RTT protocols that are efficient enough to be deployed in practice. We believe that BFE will find applications beyond forward- secret 0-RTT protocols.</p>
