Together with my colleagues <a href="http://ramacher.at" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sebastian Ramacher</a> and <a href="https://danielslamanig.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Slamanig</a>, I wrote a series of blog posts on Puncturable Encryption for fine-grained forward security in public-key encryption. See <a href="https://profet.at/blog/pe_part1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Part I (Introduction and Motivation) and <a href="https://profet.at/blog/pe_part2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Part II (Techniques and State-of-the-Art), and <a href="https://profet.at/blog/pe_part3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Part III (Applications and Implementation).
