      <p>End-to-end authenticity in public networks plays a significant role. Namely, without authenticity, the adversary might be able to retrieve even confidential information straight away by impersonating others. Proposed solutions to establish an authenticated channel cover pre-shared key-based, password-based, and certificate-based techniques. To add confidentiality to an authenticated channel, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols usually have one of the three solutions built in.

      <p>Hybrid Authenticated Key Exchange (HAKE) mechanisms use classical, post-quantum, and QKD-based key elements to establish an authenticated and confidential channel even in the event of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. Notably, such mechanisms can be fault-tolerant, meaning that even if some of the components fail or are turned off, the channel is still authenticated and confidential. HAKE schemes can come in many flavours with a variety of properties and can be adjusted to the application scenario or use case yielding a modular approach to mitigate the transition from non-quantum to quantum-safe systems. Moreover, a novel HAKE instantiation (avoiding the quadratic increase of pre-shared keys in large networks) is presented that allows end-to-end authenticity and confidentially even if two of the three components above fail or are turned off. This could be particularly interesting for upcoming long-range QKD networks such as the EuroQCI. The outline of the presentation is as follows: i) Motivation of hybrid AKE (HAKE) incorporating classical, post-quantum, and QKD mechanism, ii) Presenting the cryptographic concept with a state-of-the-art overview, iii) Enhanced HAKE protocol proposal with end-to-end authentication, and iv) Outlook.</p>

      <p>Forward security is an essential design goal of modern cryptographic protocols with a long body of literature in several application domains such as interactive key-establishment protocols (prominently, in TLS 1.3), digital signatures, search on encrypted data, updatable cryptography, mobile Cloud backups, decentralized contact tracing, new approaches to Tor, and even novel distributed protocols such as Dfinity’s Internet Computer, among others. The well-known benefit of forward security is the mitigation of key leakage by evolving secret keys over epochs and thereby revoking access to prior-epoch ciphertexts. Such a strong security guarantee is highly recognized by industry to be included into security products (e.g., by companies such as Google, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Cloudflare), particularly resulting in over 99% of Internet sites surveyed by Qualys SSL Labs (https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse) support at least some form of forward security at the time of writing. 
  Green and Miers (S&amp;P 2015) initiated the studies of puncturable encryption (PE) as a new cryptographic primitive towards the strong form of non-interactive forward-secure encryption (in particular, without the need of any pre-shared key material). Already several follow-up works showed the versatility of such a concept yielding a rich abstraction of forward security investigated in a variety of (data-in-transit and data-at-rest) application domains such as 0-RTT key exchange with replay protection for TLS (Eurocrypt’17, Eurocrypt’18, Asiacrypt’20, JoC’21), Google’s QUIC (Cans’20), Searchable Encryption (CCS’17, CCS’18, NDSS’21), mobile Cloud backups (OSDI’20), Content Distribution Networks (Financial Crypto’21), Tor (PoPETS’20), and Updatable Encryption (ePrint’21).
  Loosely speaking, PE is a promising variant of public-key encryption that allows realizing the property of fine-grained and non-interactive forward security with several useful applications. This talk provides an exhausting overview to the concept of PE with motivation, presents state-of-the-art research on PE schemes, and discusses applications (such as 0-RTT key exchange with forward security and replay protection, and forward security for Content Delivery Networks). The overall goal is to make PE more accessible to the general audience and industry in a developer-friendly way, and also presenting new insights and results.
  The presentation builds on an existing blog post with the same title (https://profet.at/blog/pe).</p>

      <p>Forward secrecy is an important feature for modern cryptographic systems and is widely used in secure messaging such as Signal and WhatsApp as well as in common Internet protocols such as TLS, IPSec or SSH. The benefits of forward secrecy is that the damage in case of key-leakage is mitigated. Forward-secret encryption schemes provides security of past ciphertexts even if secret key leaks, which is interesting in settings where cryptographic keys often reside in memory for quite a long time and could be extracted by an adversary, e.g., in cloud computing. The recent concept of puncturable encryption (PE; IEEE S&amp;P’15) provides a versatile generalization of forward-secret encryption: it allows to puncture secret keys with respect to ciphertexts to prevent the future decryption of these ciphertexts. Thus it represents a fine-grained mechanism to restrict decryption capabilities of a secret key to reduce damage in case of key leakage. We introduce the abstraction of allow-list/deny-list encryption schemes, and classify different types of PE schemes using this abstraction. Based on our classification we identify and close a gap in existing work by introducing a novel variant of PE which we dub Dual-Form Puncturable Encryption (DFPE). DFPE significantly enhances and in particular generalizes previous variants of PE, by allowing an interleaved application of allow- and deny-list operations. We present a construction of DFPE in prime order bilinear groups based on the novel primitive of tagged hierarchical identity-based encryption (THIBE). We discuss a direct application of DPFE for enhancing security guarantees within Cloudflare’s Geo Key Manager and show its generic use to construct forward-secret IBE and forward-secret digital signatures.</p>

      <p>Blockchain technologies recently received a considerable amount of attention. While the initial focus was mainly on the use of blockchains in the context of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, application scenarios now go far beyond this. Most blockchains have the property that once some object, e.g., a block or a transaction, has been registered to be included into the blockchain, it is persisted and there are no means to modify it again. While this is an essential feature of most blockchain scenarios, it is still often desirable—at times it may be even legally required–to allow for breaking this immutability in a controlled way. Only recently, Ateniese et al. (EuroS&amp;P 2017) proposed an elegant solution to this problem on the block level. Thereby, the authors replace standard hash functions with so-called chameleon-hashes (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS 2000). While their work seems to offer a suited solution to the problem of controlled re-writing of blockchains, their approach is too coarse-grained in that it only offers an all-or-nothing solution. We revisit this idea and introduce the novel concept of policy-based chameleon-hashes (PBCH). PBCHs generalize the notion of chameleon-hashes by giving the party computing a hash the ability to associate access policies to the generated hashes. Anyone who possesses enough privileges to satisfy the policy can then find arbitrary collisions for a given hash. We then apply this concept to transaction-level rewriting within blockchains, and thus support fine-grained and controlled modifiability of blockchain objects. Besides modeling PBCHs, we present a generic construction of PBCHs (using a strengthened version of chameleon-hashes with ephemeral trapdoors which we also introduce), rigorously prove its security, and instantiate it with efficient building blocks. We report first implementation results.</p>

      <p>We revisit the notion of proxy re-encryption (PRE), an enhanced public-key encryption primitive envisioned by Blaze et al. (Eurocrypt’98) and formalized by Ateniese et al. (NDSS’05) for delegating decryption rights from a delegator to a delegatee using a semi- trusted proxy. PRE notably allows to craft re-encryption keys in order to equip the proxy with the power of transforming ciphertexts under a delegator’s public key to ciphertexts under a delegatee’s public key, while not learning anything about the underlying plaintexts. We study an attractive cryptographic property for PRE, namely that of forward secrecy. In our forward-secret PRE (fs-PRE) definition, the proxy periodically evolves the re-encryption keys and permanently erases old versions while he delegator’s public key is kept constant. As a consequence, ciphertexts for old periods are no longer re-encryptable and, in particular, cannot be decrypted anymore at the delegatee’s end. Moreover, delegators evolve their secret keys too, and, thus, not even they can decrypt old ciphertexts once their key material from past periods has been deleted. This, as we will discuss, directly has application in short-term data/message-sharing scenarios. Technically, we formalize fs-PRE. Thereby, we identify a subtle but significant gap in the well-established security model for conventional PRE and close it with our formalization (which we dub fs-PRE+). We present the first provably secure and efficient constructions of fs-PRE as well as PRE (implied by the former) satisfying the strong fs-PRE+ and PRE+ notions, respectively. All our constructions are instantiable in the standard model under standard assumptions and our central build- ing block are hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) schemes that only need to be selectively secure.</p>

Indeed, carefully choosing these tag spaces provides new ways to partition the set of possible message-tag pairs into "signable" and "unsignable" pairs.

      <p>At Eurocrypt 2011, Wee presented a generalization of threshold public key encryption, threshold signatures, and revocation schemes arising from threshold extractable hash proof systems. In particular, he gave instances of his generic revocation scheme from the DDH assumption (which led to the Naor-Pinkas revocation scheme), and from the factoring assumption (which led to a new revocation scheme). We expand on Wee’s work in two directions: (a) We propose threshold extractable hash proof instantiations from the “Extended Decisional Diffie-Hellman” (EDDH) assumption due to Hemenway and Ostrovsky (PKC 2012). This in particular yields EDDH-based variants of threshold public key encryption, threshold signatures, and revocation schemes. In detail, this yields a DCR-based revocation scheme. (b) We show that our EDDH-based revocation scheme allows for a mild form of traitor tracing (and, thus, yields a new trace-and-revoke scheme). In particular, compared to Wee’s factoring-based scheme, our DCR-based scheme has the advantage that it allows to trace traitors.</p>

      <p>We adapt the concept of a programmable hash function (PHF, Crypto 2008) to a setting in which a multilinear map is available. This enables new PHFs with previously unachieved parameters. To demonstrate their usefulness, we show how our (standard-model) PHFs can replace random oracles in several well-known cryptographic constructions. Namely, we obtain standard-model versions of the Boneh-Franklin identity-based encryption scheme, the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature scheme, and the Sakai-Ohgishi-Kasahara identity-based non- interactive key exchange (ID-NIKE) scheme. The ID-NIKE scheme is the first scheme of its kind in the standard model. Our abstraction also allows to derive hierarchical versions of the above schemes in settings with multilinear maps. This in particular yields simple and efficient hierarchical generalizations of the BF, BLS, and SOK schemes. In the case of hierarchical ID-NIKE, ours is the first such scheme with full security, in either the random oracle model or the standard model. While our constructions are formulated with respect to a generic multilinear map, we also outline the necessary adaptations required for the recent “noisy” multilinear map candidate due to Garg, Gentry, and Halevi.</p>
