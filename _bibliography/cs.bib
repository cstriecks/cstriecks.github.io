  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract  = {Cryptographic objects with updating capabilities have been proposed by Bellare, Goldreich, and Goldwasser (CRYPTO'94) under the umbrella of incremental cryptography. They have recently seen increased interest, motivated by theoretical questions (Ananth et al., EC'17) as well as concrete practical motivations (Lehmann et al., EC'18; Groth et al. CRYPTO'18; Klooß et al., EC'19). In this work, the form of updatability we are particularly interested in is that primitives are key-updatable and allow to update old cryptographic objects, e.g., signatures or message authentication codes, from the old key to the updated key at the same time without requiring full access to the new key (i.e., only via a so-called update token). Inspired by the rigorous study of updatable encryption by Lehmann and Tackmann (EC'18) and Boyd et al. (CRYPTO'20), we introduce a definitional framework for updatable signatures (USs) and message authentication codes (UMACs). We discuss several applications demonstrating that such primitives can be useful in practical applications, especially around key rotation in various domains, as well as serve as building blocks in other cryptographic schemes. We then turn to constructions and our focus there is on ones that are secure and practically efficient. In particular, we provide generic constructions from key-homomorphic primitives (signatures and PRFs) as well as direct constructions. This allows us to instantiate these primitives from various assumptions such as DDH or CDH (latter in bilinear groups), or the (R)LWE and the SIS assumptions. As an example, we obtain highly practical US schemes from BLS signatures or UMAC schemes from the Naor-Pinkas-Reingold PRF.},

  abstract  = {Forward secrecy is an important feature for modern cryptographic systems and is widely used in secure messaging such as Signal and WhatsApp as well as in common Internet protocols such as TLS, IPSec or SSH. The benefits of forward secrecy is that the damage in case of key-leakage is mitigated. Forward-secret encryption schemes provides security of past ciphertexts even if secret key leaks, which is interesting in settings where cryptographic keys often reside in memory for quite a long time and could be extracted by an adversary, e.g., in cloud computing. The recent concept of puncturable encryption (PE; IEEE S&P'15) provides a versatile generalization of forward-secret encryption: it allows to puncture secret keys with respect to ciphertexts to prevent the future decryption of these ciphertexts. Thus it represents a fine-grained mechanism to restrict decryption capabilities of a secret key to reduce damage in case of key leakage. We introduce the abstraction of allow-list/deny-list encryption schemes, and classify different types of PE schemes using this abstraction. Based on our classification we identify and close a gap in existing work by introducing a novel variant of PE which we dub Dual-Form Puncturable Encryption (DFPE). DFPE significantly enhances and in particular generalizes previous variants of PE, by allowing an interleaved application of allow- and deny-list operations. We present a construction of DFPE in prime order bilinear groups based on the novel primitive of tagged hierarchical identity-based encryption (THIBE). We discuss a direct application of DPFE for enhancing security guarantees within Cloudflare's Geo Key Manager and show its generic use to construct forward-secret IBE and forward-secret digital signatures.},

  title     = {Bloom Filter Encryption and Applications to Efficient Forward-Secret
               0-RTT Key Exchange},
  abstract  = {Forward secrecy is considered an essential design goal of modern key establishment (KE) protocols, such as TLS 1.3, for example. Furthermore, efficiency considerations such as zero round-trip time (0-RTT), where a client is able to send cryptographically protected payload data along with the very first KE message, are motivated by the practical demand for secure low-latency communication. For a long time, it was unclear whether protocols that simultaneously achieve 0-RTT and full forward secrecy exist. Only recently, the first forward-secret 0-RTT protocol was described by Günther et al. (EUROCRYPT 2017). It is based on Puncturable Encryption. Forward secrecy is achieved by “puncturing” the secret key after each decryption operation, such that a given ciphertext can only be decrypted once (cf. also Green and Miers, S&P 2015). Unfortunately, their scheme is completely impractical, since one puncturing operation takes between 30 seconds and several minutes for reasonable security and deployment parameters, such that this solution is only a first feasibility result, but not efficient enough to be deployed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new primitive that we term Bloom Filter Encryption (BFE), which is derived from the probabilistic Bloom filter data structure. We describe different constructions of BFE schemes, and show how these yield new puncturable encryption mechanisms with extremely efficient puncturing. Most importantly, a puncturing operation only involves a small number of very efficient computations, plus the deletion of certain parts of the secret key, which outperforms previous constructions by orders of magnitude. This gives rise to the first forward-secret 0-RTT protocols that are efficient enough to be deployed in practice. We believe that BFE will find applications beyond forward-secret 0-RTT protocols.},

  abstract  = {Public-key encryption (PKE) schemes or key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) are fundamental cryptographic building blocks to realize secure communication protocols. There are several known transformations that generically turn weakly secure schemes into strongly (i.e., IND-CCA) secure ones. While most of these transformations require the weakly secure scheme to provide perfect correctness, Hofheinz, Hövelmanns, and Kiltz (HHK) (TCC 2017) have recently shown that variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform can work with schemes that have negligible correctness error in the (quantum) random oracle model (QROM). Many recent schemes in the NIST post-quantum competition (PQC) use variants of these transformations. Some of their CPA-secure versions even have a non-negligible correctness error and so the techniques of HHK cannot be applied. In this work, we study the setting of generically transforming PKE schemes with potentially large, i.e., non-negligible, correctness error to ones having negligible correctness error. While there have been previous treatments in an asymptotic setting by Dwork et al. (EUROCRYPT 2004), our goal is to come up with practically efficient compilers in a concrete setting and apply them in two different contexts: firstly, we show how to generically transform weakly secure deterministic or randomized PKEs into CCA-secure KEMs in the (Q)ROM using variants of HHK. This applies to essentially all candidates to the NIST PQC based on lattices and codes with non-negligible error, for which we provide an extensive analysis. We thereby show that it improves some of the code-based candidates. Secondly, we study puncturable KEMs in terms of the Bloom Filter KEM (BFKEM) proposed by Derler et al. (EUROCRYPT 2018) which inherently have a non-negligible correctness error. BFKEMs are a building block to construct fully forward-secret zero round-trip time (0-RTT) key-exchange protocols. In particular, we show how to achieve the first post-quantum secure BFKEM generically from lattices and codes by applying our techniques to identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes with (non-)negligible correctness error.},

  abstract  = {Incentive systems (such as customer loyalty systems) are omnipresent nowadays and deployed in several areas such as retail, travel, and financial services. Despite the benefits for customers and companies, this involves large amounts of sensitive data being transferred and analyzed. These concerns initiated research on privacy-preserving incentive systems, where users register with a provider and are then able to privately earn and spend incentive points. In this paper we construct an incentive system that improves upon the state-of-the-art in several ways: (1) We improve efficiency of the Earn protocol by replacing costly zero-knowledge proofs with a short structure-preserving signature on equivalence classes. (2) We enable tracing of remainder tokens from double-spending transactions without losing backward unlinkability. (3) We allow for secure recovery of failed Spend protocol runs (where usually, any retries would be counted as double-spending attempts). (4) We guarantee that corrupt users cannot falsely blame other corrupt users for their double-spending. We propose an extended formal model of incentive systems and a concrete instantiation using homomorphic Pedersen commitments, ElGamal encryption, structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes (SPS-EQ), and zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge. We formally prove our construction secure and present benchmarks showing its practical efficiency.},

  abstract	= {In the past several years, autonomous driving turned out to be a target for many technical players. Automated driving requires new and advanced mechanisms to provide safe functionality and the increased communication makes automated vehicles more vulnerable to attacks. Security is already well-established in some domains, such as the IT sector, and now spills over to Automotive. In order to not reinvent the wheel, existing security methods and tools can be evaluated and adapted to be applicable in other domains, such as Automotive. In the European H2020 ECSEL project SECREDAS, this approach is followed and existing methods, tools, protocols, best practices etc. are analyzed, combined and improved to be applicable in the field of connected vehicles. To provide modular and reusable designs, solutions are collected in form of design patterns. The SECREDAS design patterns describe solution templates to solve security, safety and privacy issues related to automated systems. The grouping and classification of design patterns is important to facilitate the selection process which is a challenging task and weak classification schemes can be a reason for a sparse application of security patterns, which represent a subgroup of design patterns. This work aims to assist automotive software and systems engineers in adopting and using technologies available on the market. The SECREDAS security patterns are based on existing technologies, so-called Common Technology Elements, and describe how and where to apply them in context of connected vehicles by making a reference to a generic architecture. This allows developers to easily find solutions to common problems and reduces the development effort by providing concrete, trustworthy solutions. The whole approach and classification scheme is illustrated based on one example security pattern.},
